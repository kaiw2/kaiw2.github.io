    <div id="about" class="bkg-light">
      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>My major and minor combination at the University of Illinois has allowed me to explore creative fields such as web development and UI/UX design. It has become a passion of mine to learn how to make graphics and interfaces with accessibility in mind, especially as technology is connecting more and more people.</p>
      <p>As such, I've taken the liberty to take courses at my university and enroll in online supplementary courses that are related to my major and concentration. I hope to be able to put my creativity and skills to use at a company with the same end goal as me: an accessible product.</p>
      <p>Major: Bachelor of Science in Computer Science & Anthropology (Graduation Date: Dec 2021)</p>
      <p>Minor: Art + Design</p>
